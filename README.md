# Election Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to write a Python script to determine the results and complete the election audit of a local Colorado congressional election. 

## Results 
A Python script was written to determine the election results. We read the data from the CSV file(https://github.com/chinzjay/Election_Analysis/tree/main/Resources) and the output was printed to a text file(https://github.com/chinzjay/Election_Analysis/tree/main/analysis). Using for loops, conditionals and logical operators, the winner of the local election was determined. Similarly, we identified the county voter turnout and the percentage of votes for the individual counties. 

The report includes analysis on candidate vote counts turnout as well as breakdown by counties.
